I love to run. I believe staying fit and taking care of your body is the most important thing you can do for yourself. So never underestimate your power to take on new challenges. <strong>Believe in yourself.</strong> Also, do not forget to keep track of your activities for a rewarding experience that will instil a sense of accomplishment.
